# Minigames
## Guessing the Number
User must select a difficulty level (Easy, medium or hard). Each one of them gives you a different number of lives, so you can spend it trying to guess the randomly generated number. You must lose as minimum life as possible, so you can end the game with the highest score.

This game was my first code using C++. By doing so, I learned the proglang syntaxe, basic conceptions such as: input, output, random generation, basic data structures, etc.

## The Hangman
User must guess which is the correct word to save John Doe from hanging. The code will give you the size of the word (represented by the underscores at the beginning of each trial) and keep updating it based on your guessing. Here, we consider a maximum of 6 chances, one for each part of the John's body, if you miss it, he dies. In addition, you can also add new words to the database.

Oh yeah, here things got interesting. More complex string manipulation (compared to previous game), ifstream, ofstream, etc.
